/* By default our JavaScript code is executed from a top to bottom, line by line however we can change
this with Control Flow. Control Flow allows our program to make decision about what code is executed and when.
JS control flow is all about how we control the flow of our code this is done by using javascript's conditional statements
and loops, and finally using control flow makes our projects more powerful, more dynamic and more interactive
*/

// Conditional Statements
/*  Conditional Statements are basically checks to
see if a certain condition is either true or flase.
If the condition is true then run code A, if it's false then run B
1. if statements
2. switch
3. ternary
*/

// JavaScript Loops
/*  Loops allow us to perform repetitive tasks with less code. For example using loops we can
iterate over an array and perform some sort of action on each piece of data in the array, or
we can use a loop to compile a list of all the items. 
1. for loops
2. do/while loop
3. for..in
4.for..of
