/* Higher Order Functions
They are functions that take functions as an argument or
return the function as an output.
For example map() method is a higher order function. It also takes 
function  as an argument

*/

// const double = (n) => n * 2;
// let nums = [1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7];
// let result = nums.map(double); // map function taking function as an argument. It is built in high Order function

// console.log(...result);

// const pTag = document.getElementById('p');

// const btn = document.getElementById('btn');

// //EvenetListener is also built in high order function that takes function as an argument
// btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
// 	pTag.innerText = 'Comparison kills creativity';
// });

/* Advantages of using High-Order Functions is that they can be
reused dynamically for example with the built in map method we can do 
different things to the array supplied if it's  number we can double them
or we can square them if it's a string we can set them to lowercase or uppercase.


They are so powerful because they are dynamic

/* In JavaScript functions are known as first class citizens or first class objects,
this mean they can be used as any other value, we can create them with literals, we can store
them as variables */
